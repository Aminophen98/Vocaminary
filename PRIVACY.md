# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** October 25, 2025

YouTube Subtitle Overlay takes your privacy seriously. This document explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.

## TL;DR

- **No personal data collection** - We don't collect names, emails, or browsing history
- **All processing happens locally** - Your viewing activity stays on your computer
- **Optional cloud features** - You choose if you want to use cloud-based subtitle caching
- **Open source** - All code is reviewable on GitHub

## Data Storage

### Local Storage (Chrome Storage API)

The extension stores the following data **locally on your device**:

- **Extension settings**: API mode (own/public), subtitle source preference, OpenAI API key (if provided)
- **Authentication tokens**: JWT tokens for Vocaminary API (if you authenticate)
- **Cache data**: Recently viewed video IDs and their subtitle timings
- **Error logs**: Technical error messages for debugging (stored temporarily)

**Purpose**: To provide fast subtitle loading and remember your preferences.

**Retention**: Cached subtitles expire after 7 days. Settings persist until you uninstall the extension.

### IndexedDB

The extension uses IndexedDB to cache subtitle data locally.

- **What's stored**: Video IDs, subtitle text, word-level timings, language codes
- **Purpose**: Avoid re-fetching subtitles for videos you've already watched
- **Retention**: 7 days, then automatically deleted
- **Size**: Typically a few KB per video

## Network Requests

### YouTube.com

The extension runs on YouTube pages to detect videos and synchronize subtitles with playback.

- **What we access**: Video player elements, current playback time, video ID from the URL
- **What we send**: Nothing. The extension only reads from YouTube's page.

### Vocaminary API (app.vocaminary.com)

Optional cloud service for faster subtitle loading and cross-device caching.

**Endpoints used:**

- `POST /api/subtitles/fetch-or-cache` - Check if subtitles are already cached server-side
- `POST /api/subtitles/store-cache` - Share your cached subtitles with other users (anonymous)
- `POST /api/subtitles/log-fetch` - Log fetch events for rate limiting and analytics
- `POST /api/railway-health/log` - Monitor API health

**Data sent:**

- Video ID (e.g., "dQw4w9WgXcQ")
- Language code (e.g., "en")
- Authentication token (if you're logged in to Vocaminary)

**Data received:**

- Subtitle content with word-level timing
- Cache metadata (source, type, timestamp)

**IP logging**: The server may log IP addresses temporarily for rate limiting purposes.

### Local yt-dlp Server (localhost:5000)

If you run the optional local Python server, all subtitle extraction happens on your own computer.

- **No external network requests** - The server fetches from YouTube directly
- **No data leaves your device**
- **Your IP = Your YouTube rate limits**

### OpenAI API (Optional)

If you provide your own OpenAI API key, the extension may send word definitions to OpenAI for AI-powered translations.

- **What's sent**: Individual words clicked by you
- **What's received**: Definitions, translations, example sentences
- **OpenAI's privacy policy applies**: https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy

**We do not store or log your API key** - it's only saved in Chrome's secure storage on your device.
