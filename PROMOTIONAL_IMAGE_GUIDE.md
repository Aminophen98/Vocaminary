- **Size**: 440x280 pixels (exact)
- **Format**: PNG or JPEG

## Why Create Promotional Images?

**Benefits:**

## Quick Decision

**Skip promotional images if:**

- You plan to create them later

**Create promotional images if:**
- You have 30-60 minutes
- You plan to go public eventually
- You want a professional look from day 1
- You have design skills or tools

│            Learn Languages Naturally     │

### Tools for Professional Design:

**Canva Pro (30-day free trial):**
- Access to premium templates
- Better fonts and graphics
- Remove background feature

**Figma (Free):**

**Photoshop/GIMP:**
- If you have design skills

- Most time-consuming

## Option 3: Use Existing Assets (10 minutes)

If you already have:
- Website header graphics
- Social media banners
- Logo and branding materials

### Quick Adaptation:

1. **Open existing graphic** in editor
2. **Resize canvas** to 440x280
3. **Adjust text** if needed (make sure readable at small size)
4. **Center important elements**
5. **Export as PNG**

---

## Design Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Keep it simple and clean
- Use high-contrast text (readable)
- Make extension icon prominent
- Use consistent branding
- Test at actual size (looks small!)
- Ensure text is readable at thumbnail size

### ❌ DON'T:
- Use too much text (2-3 short lines max)
- Use busy backgrounds (distracting)
- Use low-contrast colors (hard to read)
- Include screenshots (use separate screenshots section)
- Use copyrighted images or fonts
- Make it too complicated

---

## Quick & Dirty Method (5 minutes)

If you're really short on time:

1. **Open Paint or Paint.NET**
2. **Create new image**: 440x280 pixels
3. **Fill with solid color** (choose brand color or blue)
4. **Add text tool**:
   - Type "Vocaminary"
   - Large font (36-48pt)
   - White or contrasting color
   - Center it
5. **Add second line**:
   - "Word-Perfect YouTube Subtitles"
   - Smaller font (18-24pt)
   - Below the title
6. **Optional**: Paste your icon128.png on the left side
7. **Save as PNG**: `vocaminary-promo-440x280.png`

**It's not fancy, but it works!**

## When to Skip Promotional Images

**You can successfully submit without them if:**

**You can always add them later:**
- Chrome Web Store allows updating promotional images
- You can submit now, design later
- Won't affect approval process

## File Naming

Save as:
```
vocaminary-promo-440x280.png
```

Keep in `store-assets/` folder with screenshots.

## After Creating Promotional Images

### Checklist:
- [ ] Exactly 440x280 pixels
- [ ] PNG or JPEG format
- [ ] Text is readable (test at actual size)
- [ ] Brand consistent
- [ ] No copyrighted content
- [ ] File saved with clear name

---

## My Recommendation for You

**For Unlisted Extension:**
- **Priority**: Low (optional)
- **Time Investment**: 15-30 minutes if you want to do it
- **Impact**: Minimal for unlisted, but good for future

**Suggested approach:**
1. Submit to Chrome Web Store WITHOUT promotional images first
2. Get approved (1-7 days)
3. Create promotional images while waiting or after approval
4. Add them to your store listing later

**OR**

If you have 15 minutes:
- Use Canva quick method
- Create simple tile with icon + text
- Done and looks professional

---

## Next Steps

Once promotional images are ready (or skipped):
1. Save in `store-assets/` folder
2. Move on to final submission guide
3. You'll upload these in Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard under "Store Listing" → "Graphic assets"

## Questions?

**"Do I really need this?"**
- No, especially for unlisted extensions
- Screenshots are far more important

**"Can I use AI to generate?"**
- Yes! Midjourney, DALL-E, etc.
- But keep it simple and relevant
- Text-based designs are safer

**"Can I hire someone?"**
- Fiverr: $5-20 for simple design
- 99designs: More expensive but professional
- Usually 1-3 day turnaround

Let me know if you want to create these now or skip for later!
