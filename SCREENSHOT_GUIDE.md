## What If You Can't Take Screenshots Right Now?

**Option 1: Minimum Viable Submission**
- Chrome Web Store allows submission with just 1 screenshot
- Take ONE good screenshot of the player button
- You can add more screenshots later after approval

**Option 2: Use Existing Images**
- Check if you have any demo images from development
- Resize them to 1280x800
- Ensure they still look professional

**Option 3: Submit Without (Not Recommended)**
- Some extensions get approved without screenshots
- But it significantly reduces approval chances
- And makes your listing look unprofessional

## Need Help?

If you're stuck on screenshots:
1. I can guide you through specific steps
2. We can do a quick test recording together
3. Or we can submit with 1 basic screenshot and add more later

The key is: **at least 1 screenshot showing your extension button on YouTube player**. Everything else is nice-to-have.

Once you have screenshots:
1. Save them in a `store-assets/` folder
2. Keep originals and 1280x800 versions
3. You'll upload them directly in Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard
4. Move on to creating promotional images (optional)
